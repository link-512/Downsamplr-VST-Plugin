# Downsamplr


Downsamplr is a free, open source VST sampler plugin with a focus on creating unqiue noise and ambient tones through bitcrushing and feedback loops.  Using the in plugin bitcrush and delay settings many tones can be created from a single sample.  Pre and post bitcrush toggles allow for more harsh crushed tones, or softer ambient focus tones.  Full bitrate reduction and a sample reduction of up to 50 times can create extremely harsh noises reminiscent of circut bent hardware.  The in plugin reverb and delay, as well as the bitcrush presence can then tune down and soften harsher tones to add extra texture layers to a pad, drone, or pluck.  This plugin currently supports .WAV and .AIFF sample files.

To install simply move the VST3 file to your operating system's directory.
